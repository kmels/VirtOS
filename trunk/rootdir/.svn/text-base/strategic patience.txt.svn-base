Practice Strategic Patience

Google’s mission “to organize the world’s information
and make it universally accessible
and useful” is so broad as to be imperial, yet
Google clearly takes it seriously. Beyond its
core search and advertising capabilities, the
company has embarked on ventures involving
online productivity, blogging, radio and television
advertising, online payments, social networks,
mobile phone operating systems, and
many more information domains.
What information management tools the
company hasn’t developed it has acquired:
Picasa for photo management; YouTube for
online videos; DoubleClick for web ads; Keyhole
for satellite photos (now Google Earth);
Urchin for web analytics (now Google Analytics).
Google seeks to master not only bits
but also electrons: It recently announced an
ambitious project to generate low-cost green
electricity. While few of these ventures make
money today, they are all bricks in the wall of
its ambitious strategy, and few doubt Google’s
resolve or its ability to make progress toward
the ultimate goal. Almost every day the company
announces a new product or feature that
chips away at information disorganization.
With such a farsighted mission, the shortterm
profitability of a new offering doesn’t
seem to matter as much to Google as it might
to other businesses. The company’s managers
are strategically patient. CEO Eric Schmidt
has estimated that it will take 300 years to
achieve the mission of organizing the world’s
information. His 1,200-quarter forecast might
invite smirking; still, it illustrates Google’s
long-term approach to building value and
capability. Google, unlike many companies,
can afford its broad mission and collection of
innovations simply because its search-based
advertising is a fantastically profitable product
that provides cover for many unprofitable
ones. The company certainly cares about
accumulating customers, but its executives
believe that over time the business model
and the money will take care of themselves.
At a 2007 Bear Stearns conference, Schmidt
put it this way: “Ubiquity first, revenues
later….If you can build a sustainable eyeball
business, you can always find clever ways to
monetize them.”
In other words, not everything will take
300 years. If Google’s expressed mission is to
organize the world’s information, it has a
somewhat less exalted but equally important
unexpressed commercial mission: to monetize
consumers’ intentions as revealed by
their searches and other online behavior.
Search-based advertising is the first highly
successful instantiation of this mission.
What makes strategic patience work for
Google are the company’s clarity of purpose
and attention to detail. Everything Google
does extends its reach. It is informational
kudzu, always putting down new roots based
on the thoroughly internalized principle
that information shall be organized by analyzing
users’ intentions. Companies aiming
to learn from Google must first understand
that clear, simple directives underlie the vast
infrastructure and ostensible chaos that we’ll
describe here.
